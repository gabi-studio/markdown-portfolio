## About me:

Hello, my name is Gabi. I'm a lifelong learner and a collector of hobbies. Currently, I'm on the path of becoming a full stack web developer! 

I enjoy travelling, hiking, cooking, tabletop activities, reading, photography, and home cafe.

I am inspired by beauty, everyday magic, nature, and humans.
